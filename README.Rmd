# similiars

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of similiars is to match strings to the most similiar string in another vector.

## Installation

You can install the released version of similiars with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("similiars")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example. How similiar is `aple` to the strings `banana, apple and pineapple`.

```{r example}
library(similiars)
find_string_distance("aple",
                     c("banana", "apple", "pineapple"))
```

The other function included is `find_`

```{r example2}
library(similiars)
library(stringr)

x <- c("aple", "anana", "pech")
find_most_similiar_string(x, fruit)

```
